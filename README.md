# Team 935 Scouting
- A high-performance, cross-platform scouting solution designed for the intensity of FRC competitions. Built with a modern web stack and bridged via Capacitor for native tablet performance, this app ensures your strategy     team has the data they need, when they need it.

## Hardware Requirements
- To get the most out of this system, we recommend:

- Tablets: Amazon Fire HD 8 (7th and 8th Gen) or any Android-compatible tablet.

- Lead Scout Laptop: A laptop with 6+ hours of battery life to last through quals.

- Data Entry: A standard webcam (integrated or USB) for scanning data QR codes.

## Getting Started
- We provide two distinct versions of the application to streamline your workflow:

- The Tablet App (.apk): Optimized for scouts in the stands to record match data offline.

- The Desktop App (.exe): Designed for the Lead Scout/Drive Team to aggregate and analyze data.

Note: As of January 2026, these apps are distributed via direct download. You do not need an App Store account to use them; simply download the latest versions from our Releases page.

## Setting Up Tablets (Android/Fire OS)
- Since this app is distributed as an APK, follow these steps to install it on your scouting tablets:

- Enable Unknown Sources: Go to Settings > Security (or Privacy) and toggle on "Apps from Unknown Sources" so you can install the file directly.

- Download the APK: Download the Team935Scouting.apk from the latest GitHub Release using the tablet's browser.

- Install: Open your Downloads folder, tap the file, and select Install.

- Offline Use: Once installed, the app runs entirely locally. No pit Wi-Fi or cellular data is required during scouting.

## Setting Up Laptop/PC
- The desktop version acts as your "Central Command" for data collection.

- Download: Grab the Team935Scouting-Setup.exe from the GitHub Releases section.

- Launch: Run the installer. If Windows SmartScreen appears (since the app isn't "signed"), click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway."

Permissions: Ensure the app has permission to access your Webcam. This is critical for scanning the QR codes generated by the tablets.

Data Export: All scanned data is saved locally. You can export the compiled data to CSV or Excel for advanced analysis in Tableau or Google Sheets.
